    "In this project, the purpose is to train a neural network to recognize emotion in english human speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)** will be defined to be the act of teaching a neural network to recognize and identify emotions, from a given number of emotions, found in english auditory phrases. The motivation is to mimic how humans can intepret additional meaning in phrases which is not always reflected in the definition of the words in that sentence."
